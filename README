Configuration file parser with syntax validation. It parses configuration
files that uses the ini-file format (i.e. smb.conf):

# First section:
[section 1]
key1 = val1
key2 = val2

# Second section:
[section 2]
key3 = val3

Each entry in the file is retrieved as an triple with current section, the
keyword and an optional value for that keyword filled in.
