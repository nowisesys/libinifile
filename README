Configuration file parser with syntax validation. It parses configuration
files that uses the ini-file format (i.e. smb.conf):

[section 1]
key1 = val1
key2 = val2

[section 2]
key3 = val3

Each entry in the file is retrieved as an triple with current section, the
keyword and an optional value. The above snippet should generate this result:

ent( sect => section 1, key => key1, val => val1)
ent( sect => section 1, key => key2, val => val2)
ent( sect => section 2, key => key3, val => val3)

Empty and commented lines are ignored. Currently the hash character ('#') is
recognised as comment begin and everthing after it is ignored.
