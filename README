C/C++ library with syntax validator for parsing ini-style configuration files. 

This file format is commonly used by many application, among them Samba and
MySQL. The parsing can be customized by calling inifile_set_option(). Each 
entry in the file is retrieved as an triple with current section, the keyword 
and an optional value. 

An example of the ini-file format:

  [section 1]
  
    key1 = val1
    key2 = val2

  [section 2]
    
    key3 = val3

The above content should generate this result:

  ent( sect => section 1, key => key1, val => val1)
  ent( sect => section 1, key => key2, val => val2)
  ent( sect => section 2, key => key3, val => val3)

Empty and commented lines are ignored. Currently the hash character ('#') is
recognized as comment begin and everthing after it is ignored.
