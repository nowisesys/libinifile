   INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS
   
   
See the win32 directory. Currently only Visual Studio 2008 (VC9) is
supported, but it should be easy to setup and build the code using
another tool-chains or IDE.

If supporting another develop environment, please notice that this project 
has two dll-files as targets: 

  libinifile.dll   : (the C-library)
  libinifile++.dll : (the C++-library)

The C++ library shares some code with the C-library. Either use the C source
code in the C++ library or build the C-library and add a dependency on it.

No installation script exist, instead create a destination directory where 
you copy to files into (or use the source code tree as is):

  libinifile\
     +-- include\
     |      +-- inifile.h
     |      +-- inifile++.hpp
     |-- lib\
     |      +-- inifile.lib
     |      +-- inifile.dll
     |      +-- inifile++.lib
     |      +-- inifile++.dll
