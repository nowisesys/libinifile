0.6.1 (2015-10-14):

      * Support for 64-bit Windows with package script (win32/package.bat).
      
      * Clean compile on Linux using GLIBC >= 2.20. Link the C++ library
        with C-library to keep automake happy.

0.6.0 (2010-10-20):
      
      * Ported library to Windows. Project files can be found in the
        win32 directory.

      * Fixed configure scripts for new version of autoconf & co.
        Verified new version on Linux, fixed a few compiler warnings.

0.5.5 (2010-06-02):

      * Updated build system to work with autoconf 2.63.
      
0.5.4 (2008-10-21):
0.5.3 (2008-06-23):
0.5.3 (2008-06-23):
0.5.1 (2008-06-23):
      
      * Many small fixes, no new features. Most fixes are in the build
        system and the documentation (manual pages).
      
0.5.0 (2008-01-23):

      * Fixed the C++ library to use libinifile code (C library) for parsing.
        Updated the C++ interface (header). 
	
      * Adding manual page for the C++ library (libinifile++) and fixing the 
        manual page for the C library (libinifile).
      
0.4.1 (2008-01-22):

      * Adding pkg-config interface for other packages to link against this
        library.

      * Support for values spanning over multiple lines (multiline). This
        feature can be enabled/disabled by calling inifile_set_option().

0.4.0 (2008-01-21):

      * Modified API inifile_xxx_option() to allow caller to change the set
        of characters to treat as comment start and assignment characters.
	
0.3.0 (2008-01-21):
      
      * Added inifile_set_option()/inifile_get_option() to configure parser
        options. Currently its possible to enable/disable:
	o) syntax check.
	o) quoted strings check.
	o) assignment inside value.

      * Fixed API documentation of libinifile. Adding man section 3 pages
        for inifile_set_option(), inifile_get_option(), inifile_get_error() and
	inifile_clear_error().
	
0.2.1 (2008-01-20):

      * Fixed conditional building C and C++ test depending on --enable-test
        and --enable-cxx.
	
      * Added better error detection in lexer and parser. Improved error
        messages to be more fine grained.
	
0.2.0 (2008-01-16):

      * Added C-source version of the library. The library was written in
        C++ originally. The C++ version of the library is in directory cxx 
	and is conditionally built by configure the source with --enable-cxx
	and installed as libinifile++ (both shared and static by default).
      
      * Added manual pages for the C-library version of libinifile.
